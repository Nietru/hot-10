# Hot10

## Description

A website with a searchbar for user input that allows the user to enter an artist or band name.

For this project the goal was to work as a group to create a website using two different server APIs data, received in JSON.

The two APIs return data based on which artist/band the user entered into the search bar.

The first API, Youtube, returns the top ten music videos for that artist/band in the left column.

The second API, LastFM, returns the top ten albums with am image of that album cover, in the right column.

There is also a section under the search bar that stores the last 5 searches the user entered, that are stored in local-storage, and can be revisited or cleared with a click or the "clear-history" button.

During this project, we learned the importance of communication when working with our peers on a group project, and how complicated it can be to use github as a team rather than individuals.
