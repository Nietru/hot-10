# Hot10

## Description

A website with a searchbar for user input that allows the user to enter an artist or band name.

For this project the goal was to work as a group to create a website using two different server APIs data, received in JSON.

The two APIs return data based on which artist/band the user entered into the search bar.

The first API, Youtube, returns the top ten music videos for that artist/band in the left column.

The second API, LastFM, returns the top ten albums with am image of that album cover, in the right column, also by clicking on the album covers it will bring you to the LastFM homepage for that album.

There is also a section under the search bar that stores the last 5 searches the user entered, that are stored in local-storage, and can be revisited or cleared with a click or the "clear-history" button.

We used google's AMP web component framework for the homepage animations. AMP uses inline CSS.

During this project, we learned the importance of communication when working with our peers on a group project, and how complicated it can be to use github as a team rather than individuals.
